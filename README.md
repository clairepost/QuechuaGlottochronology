# QuechuaGlottochronology
This is an analysis of Quechua and other Indo-European and South American Languages.

This project uses R-Studio to create different visualizations of change over time in Quechua. I am particulary interested in how colinization has affected the Quechua language and thus have created models to analyze the significance of Spanish influence by using a Quechua translation dictionary.
