# QuechuaGlottochronology
This is analysis of Quechua and other Indo-European and Mesoamerican Languages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project uses R-Studio to create different visualizations of change over time in Quechua. I am particulary interested in how colinization has affected the Quechua language and thus have created models to analyze the significance of Spanish influence within this dictionary.

Goals for the future:
- find more dictionaries from different time periods
- compare dictionaries from different times
- do regression analysis of change
